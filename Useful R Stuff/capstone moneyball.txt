3 strike out,

Rstudio
import,
head ,
str //structure , we see almost 100,000 obs and 24 variable 
x2b - added when imported because numbers are for indexing
head(Batting$AB)

so now we need to make 3 new variables
BA - batting avg
Batting$BA <- Batting$H / Batting$AB
new BA is created

2nd variable we need is on base percent 
OBP= {H+BB+HBP}/{AB+BB+HBP+SF}
//

3rd variale
slugging percentage
{\displaystyle \mathrm {SLG} ={\frac {({\mathit {1B}})+(2\times {\mathit {2B}})+(3\times {\mathit {3B}})+(4\times {\mathit {HR}})}{AB}}}
SLG = [1*1B +2*2B +3*3B +4*hr]/AB

In baseball statistics, slugging percentage (SLG) is a popular measure of the power of a hitter. 
It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats:

For example, in 1920, Babe Ruth played his first season for the New York Yankees.
 In 458 at bats, Ruth had 172 hits, comprising 73 singles, 36 doubles, 9 triples, and 54 home runs,
 which brings the total base count to (73 × 1) + (36 × 2) + (9 × 3) + (54 × 4) = 388.
 His total number of bases (388) divided by his total at-bats (458) is .847, his slugging percentage for the season,
 setting a record that stood until 2001,
 when Barry Bonds achieved 411 bases in 476 at-bats, bringing his slugging percentage to .863, unmatched since.
