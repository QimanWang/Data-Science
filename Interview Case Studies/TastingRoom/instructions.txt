Lot18 Code Challenge
----------------------------------

The purpose of this challenge is for us to get a better idea of how you think,
organize code and tackle the problems at hand. 

----------------------------------

Acme wines is a mock wine store that delivers wine all over the country. 
When selling wine there are a number of rules and regulations that Acme 
must follow.

You've been tasked with building a mock order analyzer that will be used to 
determine if a data set of orders are considered valid or invalid. Acme often
gets a large number of orders, so your program will need to be able to process
a large amount of data quickly and efficiently. You must open and read the 
provided file (orders.csv) and analyze the data against the validation 
rules below. Your programs should then print the output to the screen with
the result

Example output (newline at end of line):
Vinton Cerf Valid
Linus Torvalds Invalid
Rasmus Lerdorf Valid
Guido van Rossum Valid

Validation rules:
1) No wine can ship to New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
Illinois, Idaho or Oregon
2) Valid zip codes must be 5 or 9 digits
3) Email address must be valid
4) The sum of digits in a zip code may not exceed 20 ("90210": 9+0+2+1+0 = 12)

Bonus points:
* Application takes a command line argument with the name of the file 
to process.
* Your code should be modular and reusable. Assume this is the first pass at a
tool to build on and maintain.
* Write unit tests
